## 1. Public APIs or Web Services
Many banks provide publicly accessible APIs or web services that share real-time data, such as exchange rates. These APIs allow external platforms to retrieve up-to-date currency information in a structured format (e.g., JSON or XML).
- Cant find any examples
- Finding an API is probably the best case scenario

## 2. Web Scraping
If APIs are not available, the site might use web scraping techniques to extract data directly from the exchange rate pages of bank websites. This involves automated scripts that fetch and parse HTML content to extract relevant data fields.

### 2.2. limited liability companies (llc)

Last night I saw many mmc's (llc) listed on the site but now its only banks so Im not sure what changed. But the best rates were from zuhur mmc but now according to yandex which I think is like yelp here in the states now says its permamently closed. [zuhur mmc review](https://yandex.com/maps/org/136685285119/?ll=49.862877%2C40.386233&z=17)
 

## 3. FTP Servers or Feeds

Some banks may offer currency rate data via FTP servers or syndicated feeds (like RSS or XML). These are periodically updated by the banks.
- Im not sure how this would work, is it a lower tech api?
- This would work if we can find a bank that offers this service. 
   

## 4. Data Aggregators
Instead of direct integration with each bank, azn.day.az might use third-party aggregators that collect and consolidate exchange rate data from multiple banks, providing it through a single API or feed.

### 4.1. banks.az
[banks.az](https://banks.az/servisler/valyuta-mezenneleri)

### 4.2. infobank.az
- The website dose not load for me. not sure what it does. 
   - Cliking on the logo at the bottom of the banks who use infobank.az takes you to the infobank.az website.
- [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/infobank-az/)
- Used by 
    1. Access Bank
    2. Afb bank
    3. Azerpost

## 5. Direct Partnerships
In some cases, sites like azn.day.az might have direct partnerships with banks, giving them access to proprietary or internal systems that publish exchange rate data.
- I think this is probably the worst case senario if this is how sites like azn.day.az pulls their data at regular intervals. This is becuase it would require a relationship with the bank and they would have to be able to access the banks internal systems.
