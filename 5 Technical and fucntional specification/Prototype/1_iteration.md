This iteration is focused on creating a basic prototype of the application that allows users to a static geneerated data of exchange rate, have a bilingual interface, and have a basic map that only shows the google api works.

## 1. Thought Process

The insperation for the data stack and the backend is from the midterm project for CM2040 Databses, Networks and the Web.
Hereâ€™s the software stack summarized in a Markdown table:

| **Category**         | **Technology**           | **Description**                                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Backend**          | Node.js                 | Runtime environment for building server-side applications.   |
|                       | Express.js              | Web application framework for routing and HTTP handling.     |
|                       | SQLite                  | Lightweight, file-based SQL database for data storage.       |
| **Frontend**         | EJS                     | Server-side rendering of HTML templates for dynamic content. |
|                       | CSS                     | Stylesheets for visual design using `main.css`.              |
| **Development Tools**| Body-Parser             | Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies (e.g., forms).|
|                       | NPM Scripts            | Custom scripts for managing the app and database operations. |
| **Directory Structure**| Routes                | Separate modules for author, reader, and main routes.        |
|                       | Views                   | EJS templates for different pages (e.g., homepage, settings).|

## 2. Project Structure

### 2.1. **Frontend**
- **Technology**: HTML with EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
- **Functionality**:
  - Display exchange rates in a table.
  - Display a Google Maps component with geolocation centered on Baku.
- **Features Added**:
  - Integration with Google Maps API to show a map.

### 2.2. **Backend**
- **Technology**: Node.js with Express.js framework.
- **Functionality**:
  - Serve dynamic content (exchange rates and translations) via `GET` endpoints.
  - Support a route to switch the current language (`/switch-language/:lang`).
  - Manage translations using a simple JavaScript file.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Middleware processes user requests and dynamically renders content.
  - A REST-like architecture simplifies further extensions.

### 2.3. **Database**
- **Technology**: None currently.
- **Future Integration**:
  - Could use SQLite for storing exchange rates, user preferences, or language settings.
  - Alternatively, data could be fetched in real-time from external APIs like `infobank.az`.

### 2.4. **Third-Party APIs**
- **Google Maps API**:
  - Used to embed a map displaying Baku with adjustable zoom and dynamic loading.

### 2.6. **Tech Stack**
| Layer         | Technology                     | Purpose                             |
|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**  | HTML, EJS                      | Display data, multilingual UI       |
| **Backend**   | Node.js, Express.js            | Serve content, handle routes        |
| **Database**  | None (potential SQLite)        | Not used yet; future for data storage |
| **APIs**      | Google Maps API                | Map visualization                   |
| **Languages** | JavaScript                     | Backend and frontend functionality  |

This simple full-stack project serves as a functional prototype for a currency exchange application with real-time map integration and multilingual support. Let me know if you'd like to extend it further!

## Next Iteration

- Language switcher with links for changing languages.
    - Dynamic, multilingual interface allowing users to switch between English, Russian, and Azerbaijani.
    - Support a route to switch the current language (`/switch-language/:lang`).
- Integration with Google Maps API to show bank locations on the map.
- Serve dynamic content (exchange rates and translations) via `GET` endpoints.
