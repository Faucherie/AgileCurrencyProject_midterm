**8.4 Technological Factors**

Azerbaijan's commitment to digital transformation is evident in initiatives like the Digital Trade Hub, which promotes electronic payments and digital commerce [1]. This shift towards a cashless society aligns with the app's goals of simplifying and streamlining financial processes.
The Azerbaijan's mobile internet infrastructure has grown rapidly, with 4G coverage now available to 94% of the population, and 5G rollout plans in progress [2]. The increasing adoption of 5G technology is expected to enhance mobile internet speeds and reduce latency, offering better user experiences for mobile applications.
The Azerbaijani government has invested significantly in IT education, launching coding programs and tech hubs to nurture local talent [3]. This is fostering an ecosystem that could support the development and maintenance of tech solutions like the currency exchange app.
Additionally, cybersecurity threats, such as phishing attacks and data breaches, are increasing globally and could pose risks to user trust and data protection [3]. Geolocation data is particularly sensitive. Mismanagement of such information can expose users to privacy risks, such as location tracking or profiling by malicious actors. Implementing anonymized geolocation queries (e.g., by rounding location coordinates to a certain range) can reduce the precision of stored data while preserving the app's functionality [4]. 

**Implications**

The widespread mobile internet and smartphone penetration in Azerbaijan provide a strong foundation for the adoption of the currency exchange application. The ongoing digital transformation and government support for tech initiatives create an enabling environment for the app's development and integration. However, rural connectivity challenges and cybersecurity risks must be addressed to ensure equitable access and user trust. Implementing strong geolocation data protection measures could mitigate these concerns.
