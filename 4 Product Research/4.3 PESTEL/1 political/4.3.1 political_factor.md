Sanctions by the U.S. Department of the Treasury targeting Azerbaijan's trade and affiliated companies which support its military-industrial complex due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. They may reduce tourism, a vital market for the currency exchange platform, as geopolitical tensions deter international travelers. Conversely, economic strain from sanctions could increase reliance on the platform among locals. During financial instability, the application’s focus on providing the best currency exchange rates and real-time data could serve as a crucial tool for managing limited resources【1】.

Political Trends: The incarceration of journalists and political figures, alongside government-imposed restrictions on media and civil society, underscores Azerbaijan's authoritarian tendencies. This political environment creates a need for the application to avoid integrating social or editorial content, focusing solely on neutral, data-driven services. Such an approach minimizes risks associated with political scrutiny while ensuring the app remains a trusted resource for users seeking objective financial tools【2】【3】.

By concentrating on unbiased data visualization and avoiding contentious areas, the platform can navigate these challenges while addressing key economic and user needs effectively.
