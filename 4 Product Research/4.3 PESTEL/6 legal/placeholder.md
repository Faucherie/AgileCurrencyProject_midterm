**8.5 Legal Factors**

Developing a currency exchange application in Azerbaijan requires adherence to several legal frameworks and considerations:
Azerbaijan’s Law on Legal Protection of Compilations of Data governs the use of publicly available data, including web scraping. Unauthorized scraping of data from bank websites or currency exchange platforms could potentially infringe on intellectual property rights. If proprietary or sensitive data is collected without explicit permission, it may lead to legal challenges. Therefore, the project should prioritize obtaining explicit permissions or licenses from banks and data providers for data usage [1].
Analysis of one of the Bank’s policies reveals that although there is no explicit prohibition of the data scrapping, however generally they prohibit use of the information from their websites [2]. Despite that majority of other banks located in Baku do not expose Terms of Service or Data Privacy policies in English, data scrapping (such as currency rates, branch addresses etc.) legality then is uncertain, and still poses legal risks.
Additionally, the application must ensure it does not inadvertently facilitate unregulated financial transactions, which may contravene laws governing financial services. While the app itself does not handle transactions, its role in connecting users to banks requires clarity in disclaimers and operational transparency.
Implications

To mitigate risks:

Obtain explicit permissions for scraping or accessing bank data to avoid intellectual property violations.
Exclude any suggestion of provision of financial services by our app. If necessary, include disclaimers clearly stating the app’s role as an informational tool, not a financial service provider, to limit liability.
Prioritize user consent and data protection measures to comply with personal data laws and safeguard user trust.
