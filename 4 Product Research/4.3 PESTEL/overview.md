# PESTEL Outline

## Political
1. **Trends of Media Freedom**
   - Declining media freedom and increased arrests of journalists highlight risks of political scrutiny.
   - **Implication:** Avoid social or editorial features; focus on neutral data visualization.
2. **Governmental Influence on Financial Institutions**
   - Potential for state interventions in banking and data reporting could affect data availability and reliability.

## Environmental
1. **Environmental Impact of Tourism**
   - Growing focus on sustainability in tourism might shift tourist preferences toward eco-conscious services and destinations.
   - **Implication:** Position the app as a paperless, environmentally responsible solution.
2. **Climate Risks**
   - Climate events (e.g., floods or heatwaves) impacting travel patterns and banking infrastructure reliability.

## Social
1.
2. 

## Technological
1. **Trends in Payment Methods**
   - Increased use of digital payment systems (credit cards, stablecoins) among tourists could reduce reliance on cash.
   - **Implication:** Monitor trends and prepare for potential shifts in user needs.
2. **API and Data Reliability**
   - Dependency on APIs like `infobank.az` for accurate and real-time data, with technological alternatives (e.g., scraping) as a backup.

## Economic
1. **Currency Trends**
   - Economic shifts, such as manat moving from a fixed rate to a float, can trigger currency exchange panic among locals.
   - **Implication:** Highlight app features that address economic uncertainty, such as real-time rates and branch geolocation.
2. **Tourism Trends**
   - Analyze specific trends:
     - Increase in certain groups (e.g., business travelers or regional tourists).
     - Decrease among others due to geopolitical or safety concerns.
   - **Implication:** Customize services to align with dominant tourist groups.

## Legal
1. **Data Collection Legality**
   - If scraping bank websites becomes necessary due to API unreliability:
     - **Legal considerations**: Check compliance with local and international laws on data scraping and intellectual property.
     - **Mitigation:** Collaborate with banks to formalize data usage agreements.
2. **Compliance with Data Privacy Laws**
   - Ensure the app adheres to GDPR-like regulations for collecting user geolocation and preference data.
