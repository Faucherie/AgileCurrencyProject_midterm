**8.6 Environmental Factors**

Environmental factors play a lesser but still relevant role in the development of a digital platform like the Baku Currency Exchange Rate Finder. While the direct environmental impact of the application is minimal, there are significant considerations regarding transportation and tourism trends.
The app's geolocation feature, which guides users to nearby exchange offices, could encourage efficient travel routes, minimizing unnecessary trips and thereby reducing carbon emissions. This aligns with broader goals of sustainable urban mobility, as highlighted in studies on geolocation and its role in reducing carbon footprints [1]. However, this benefit is contingent on the app's accuracy and real-time updates.
A growing focus on sustainability in tourism is evident globally, including in Azerbaijan, where efforts are being made to adapt tourism practices to environmental concerns [2]. According to the World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), eco-conscious tourism has seen a sharp rise in interest, with travelers actively seeking sustainable services and solutions [3]. Tourists are increasingly prioritizing eco-conscious services and destinations, and the app's digital-first, paperless approach contributes to reducing environmental waste [4]. Positioning the app as an environmentally responsible solution could enhance its appeal to eco-conscious users.
Additionally, climate risks such as floods, heatwaves, or other extreme weather events may affect travel patterns and the reliability of banking infrastructure. These events could disrupt user access to physical exchange offices or banking services [5], underscoring the importance of providing real-time updates to adapt to changing conditions.
