What Is Currency Pegging?
Currency pegging means tying a nation's currency exchange rate to that of another nation. This policy is intended to provide stability to a nation's currency and its economy by linking it to an already stable currency. Pegging often includes preset ratios, which is why a pegged currency may be called a fixed rate.

The U.S. dollar is used as a currency peg by many nations, as it is the world's reserve currency.

(In a different usage, pegging refers to the practice of manipulating the price of an underlying asset, such as a commodity, prior to the expiration of an options contract.)

Key Takeaways
Many countries stabilize their currencies by pegging their value to that of the U.S. dollar, which is considered to be the most stable currency.
Currencies that are pegged to the U.S. dollar include the Belize dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, and the United Arab Emirates dirham.
Pegging a currency can help a nation expand trade and boost real incomes but can also lead to chronic trade deficits.
Understanding Pegging
Wide currency fluctuations can do severe damage to international business transactions, which is why many countries maintain a currency peg. Keeping their currencies stable removes a barrier to trade.

Pegging to the U.S. dollar is common. The currencies of more than 66 countries are pegged to the U.S. dollar, according to AvaTrade.

Why Peg a Currency?
Currency risk is an issue for any company that imports or exports goods. For example, if a U.S. company operates in Brazil, the firm has to convert U.S. dollars into Brazilian reals (BRL) to fund its Brazilian business. If the value of Brazil’s currency changes dramatically compared to the dollar, the U.S. company may incur a loss when it converts back into U.S. dollars.

Thus, a nation that pegs its currency has an edge over the competition for international trade.

Exchange rates between pegged currencies are not necessarily 1/1. For instance, the fixed rate for a U.S. dollar is 3.67 United Arab Emirates dirham (AED).


A country's central bank goes into the open market to buy and sell its currency to maintain the pegged ratio that has been deemed optimal.

The term pegging also refers to a strategy used by some buyers and writers (sellers) of call and put options to manipulate the price of an underlying commodity in advance of the expiration of their options contracts.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Pegging
There are benefits and drawbacks for a nation to consider when deciding whether to peg its currency.

Advantages
Pegged currencies can expand trade opportunities and boost the real incomes of its citizens, keeping currency fluctuations relatively low. Individuals, businesses, and nations are free to benefit more fully from specialization and sell their goods in other countries without the associated exchange rate risk.

According to the theory of comparative advantage, everyone will be able to spend more time doing what they do best. Farmers can concentrate on their crops rather than spending time and money hedging foreign exchange risk with derivatives. Technology firms can focus on building better computers.

Perhaps most importantly, retailers in both countries can source from the most efficient producers. Pegged exchange rates make more long-term investments possible in the other country. With a currency peg, fluctuating exchange rates are not constantly disrupting supply chains and changing the value of investments.

Disadvantages
Countries can experience problems when a currency is pegged at low exchange rates. Domestic consumers are deprived of their purchasing power to buy foreign goods.

For example, the Chinese yuan is pegged against a basket of foreign currencies. If its peg is too low against the U.S. dollar, Chinese consumers will have to pay more for imported food and oil, lowering their consumption levels and their standard of living. At the same time, U.S. farmers and Middle East oil producers will lose business. This situation naturally creates trade tensions.

Other problems emerge when a currency is pegged at an overly high rate. A country may be unable to defend the peg over time. Domestic consumers will buy too many imports and consume more than they can produce. These chronic trade deficits will create downward pressure on the home currency, and the government will have to spend foreign exchange reserves to defend the peg. The government's reserves will eventually be exhausted, and the peg will collapse.

When a currency peg collapses, the country that set its peg too high will suddenly find imports more expensive. That will cause inflation to rise, and the nation may have difficulty paying its debts. The other country will find its exporters losing markets, and its investors losing money on foreign assets that are no longer worth as much in domestic currency.

Pros
Expands trade and boosts real income

Eliminates need to hedge exchange risk

Opens new opportunities for long-term investments

Cons
The power to purchase foreign goods drops

Can lead to chronic trade deficits

Higher priced imports and rising inflation

Why Peg to the U.S. Dollar?
When a country pegs its currency to the dollar, it fixes the exchange at a set, predetermined rate. The value of the currency is maintained by the country's central bank.

Since the U.S. dollar's value is on a floating rate, it fluctuates. This means that the pegged currency's value rises and drops with the dollar.

Countries that peg their currency to the dollar do so because the U.S. dollar is relatively strong and relatively stable in the international market. As the world's reserve currency, international trade often is paid in U.S. dollars. This helps keep a country's pegged currency stable.

Some countries peg to the dollar because it helps keep their currencies and, therefore, their exports priced competitively. Others. such as Singapore and Malaysia, do so because their economies are particularly reliant on trade.

Currencies Pegged to the Dollar
At least 66 nations have tied their currencies to the U.S. dollar.

Aside from the dollar's stability, some nations have additional reasons related to their economic strengths. For example, many Caribbean island nations including Aruba, Barbados, and Bermuda, rely on American tourists who are paying in dollars.

Here are some of the notable countries whose currencies are pegged to the greenback along with their rates:

Belize dollar (BZ$): 2.00
Cuba convertible peso (CUC): 1.000
Hong Kong dollar (HKD): 7.76
Panama balboa (PAB): 1.000
Saudi Arabia riyal (SAR): 3.75
United Arab Emirates dirham (AED): 3.673
Is the Yuan Pegged to the Dollar?
The Chinese yuan was pegged to the U.S. dollar from 1997 to 2005 but since then has been pegged to a basket of international currencies, including the dollar.

China's central bank maintains full control of the currency by setting a daily rate of parity against the greenback.

China changed its peg in 2005 after pressure from its major trading partners.

Which Country Has No Currency of Its Own?
Some countries choose to use the U.S. dollar rather than issue their own currencies. Among them are Zimbabwe, Ecuador, El Salvador, East Timor, and the Turks and Caicos islands.

Twenty European nations no longer issue their own currencies, having adopted the euro.

What Is a Soft Peg Versus a Hard Peg?
Hard pegs are put in place by a government, which can set the exchange rate for its currency.

The foreign exchange effectively controls the exchange rate for currencies that do not have a set exchange rate. These currencies are said to have a soft peg. The government may still take action to strengthen or weaken its currency when the need arises.

The Bottom Line
Nations that peg their currency generally do so as a way to open up trade opportunities with other nations. It makes them more attractive to foreign investment as it greatly reduces currency risk as a factor.

Nevertheless, the strategy has its risks. A nation has to set the ratio correctly, and keep defending its value, or risk serious economic effects at home.
