Azerbaijan’s currency has plummeted after moving to a floating exchange rate, causing a rush on dollars and shops as customers try to buy goods before prices increase.

The manat lost 32% to the dollar yesterday following the central bank’s decision to stop protecting its value in the face of falling oil prices. The bank said it had lost more than half its foreign reserves trying to defend the currency.

But opposition leaders criticised authorities for allowing the manat to fall so dramatically.

“Azerbaijan has moved to a floating exchange rate but someone forgot to teach it how to swim,” said Natiq Cafarli, an economist and member of the opposition Republican Alternative.

Residents of Baku were angry at the sudden announcement and scrambled to convert their manats into foreign currency or durable goods.

“This is such a miserable situation for the whole nation,” one said. “Everyone wants to buy dollars and only a few [banks and exchange offices will] sell … There are almost no dollars left at exchange points.”

An employee at Baku’s Bina shopping market said the shop had had to close to avoid losing money.

Others wanting to buy dollars and euros found many exchange offices shut or not selling hard currencies, while several banks put a $500 limit on exchanges.

“This is such a disaster for us,” said another resident. “How come they decided to bankrupt people in one night?”

Several exchange offices in Baku were selling the dollar for between 1.56 and 1.59 manats within hours of the announcement, already higher than the official rate of 1.55.

The bank said in a statement the decision to float the manat was made to “protect the country’s foreign reserves”.


Baku is heavily dependent on oil and natural gas exports but prices have fallen dramatically in recent years. A barrel of Brent crude oil was selling for $36.10 on 21 December, about 33% of the price 18 months ago.

Ali Karimli, chairman of the Azerbaijan Popular Front Party, accused the government of destroying the national currency.

“It was killed by a self-centered, corrupted, and incapable government,” Karimli said. “There will be price hikes [and] the salaries, pensions, savings – everything we have in manats is now practically devalued by 55%.”

It marks the second time this year the manat has lost significant value due to government actions. In February, a devaluation caused it to lose more than a third of its value against the dollar.

Banking expert Akram Hasanov, who works at a Baku-based IJS law firm, said this earlier devaluation had compromised the currency.

“Many other countries have devalued their currencies in recent years, but nowhere has there been the serious damage to the people and entrepreneurs as [in Azerbaijan],” said Hasanov.

He said the latest devaluation would lead to the collapse of many banks. “But [the bankruptcies of the banks] will not affect the bank owners and managers, it will be ordinary depositors [who will suffer],” Hasanov said.

Just weeks before the February devaluation, the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, called the manat “one of the most stable currencies in the world” and encouraged foreign nationals and companies to invest.

Moody’s credit rating service predicted on 21 December that Azerbaijan’s budget deficit would reach 9.2% of gross domestic product this year.

Low energy priceshave also forced Russia and Kazakhstan tofloat their currencies freely on the market. Both the Russian ruble and Kazakhstan’s tenge are at near record lows to the dollar.

How the Guardian will stand up to four more years of Donald Trump
We’ve just witnessed an extraordinary moment in the history of the United States. Throughout the tumultuous years of the first Trump presidency we never minimised or normalised the threat of his authoritarianism, and we treated his lies as a genuine danger to democracy, a threat that found its expression on 6 January 2021. 

With Trump months away from taking office again – with dramatic implications for Ukraine and the Middle East, US democracy, reproductive rights, inequality and our collective environmental future – it’s time for us to redouble our efforts to hold the president-elect and those who surround him to account. 

It’s going to be an enormous challenge. And we need your help.

Trump is a direct threat to the freedom of the press. He has, for years, stirred up hatred against reporters, calling them an “enemy of the people”. He has referred to legitimate journalism as “fake news” and joked about members of the media being shot. Project 2025, the blueprint for a second Trump presidency, includes plans to make it easier to seize journalists’ emails and phone records.

We will stand up to these threats, but it will take brave, well-funded independent journalism. It will take reporting that can’t be leaned upon by a billionaire owner terrified of retribution from the White House.
