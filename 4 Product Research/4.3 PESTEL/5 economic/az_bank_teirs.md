The banking system in Azerbaijan is structured around three primary tiers:

### 1. **Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA):**
   - **Role:** The CBA is the central monetary authority responsible for regulating and overseeing the banking system in Azerbaijan. It is tasked with maintaining price stability, managing monetary policy, and ensuring financial sector stability.
   - **Functions:**
     - **Monetary Policy Implementation:** The CBA sets interest rates, regulates money supply, and controls inflation.
     - **Issuance of Currency:** It issues the national currency, the Azerbaijani manat (AZN), and manages its stability.
     - **Regulation and Supervision:** The CBA licenses, supervises, and regulates banks and financial institutions.
     - **Foreign Exchange Management:** It oversees the foreign exchange market and sets official exchange rates.
     - **Banking Sector Development:** The CBA supports the modernization and efficiency of the banking sector.

### 2. **Operator Banks:**
   - **Definition:** Operator banks are often state-owned or partially state-owned banks that play a significant role in implementing government financial policies. They serve as intermediaries for public funds and economic initiatives.
   - **Example:** Kapital Bank, which historically served as the State Savings Bank, is one such institution that facilitates public projects and payment services.
   - **Functions:**
     - Distributing government subsidies and pensions.
     - Managing public sector accounts.
     - Facilitating major infrastructure projects in line with government directives.

### 3. **Commercial Banks:**
   - **Definition:** These are privately or publicly owned banks operating under licenses issued by the CBA. They constitute the bulk of the banking sector and provide a range of financial services to individuals, businesses, and institutions.
   - **Services:**
     - Retail Banking: Savings accounts, loans, and personal banking services.
     - Corporate Banking: Credit facilities, trade financing, and treasury services for businesses.
     - Investment Services: Limited services in asset management and securities trading.
   - **Role in the Economy:** They support economic growth by providing credit, facilitating trade, and mobilizing savings for investment.

### Regulatory and Structural Challenges:
   - **Consolidation:** Over the past decade, the number of banks has decreased due to efforts to strengthen the financial system by merging weaker banks with stronger ones.
   - **Transparency and Governance:** While reforms have improved, challenges in corporate governance and transparency persist.
   - **Dependence on Oil Revenues:** The banking system is influenced by Azerbaijanâ€™s oil-driven economy, which affects credit demand and currency stability.

### Supporting Institutions:
   - **Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FIMSA):** Although now integrated back into the CBA, FIMSA was previously responsible for regulating financial markets, including banks and insurance companies.
   - **Deposit Insurance Fund:** Provides guarantees for deposits up to a certain limit, ensuring public confidence in the banking system.

This tiered system balances central oversight with the operational flexibility of commercial and operator banks, allowing Azerbaijan's banking sector to align with national economic goals while catering to diverse financial needs.
