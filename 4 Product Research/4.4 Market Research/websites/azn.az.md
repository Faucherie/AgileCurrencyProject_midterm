9. Market Research

Developing the Baku Currency Exchange Rate Finder app requires an understanding of the current market landscape, including available tools, their limitations, and user needs. The following analysis reviews the findings from user questionnaires, evaluates existing platforms in Baku, and compares international equivalents for additional insights.

9.1. Current Solutions in Baku
https://azn.az [1]
A popular website that aggregates currency exchange rates from various banks in Azerbaijan.



Strengths:
Provides basic exchange rate information.
Includes working hours of banks and addresses linked to Google Maps.
Weaknesses:
Lacks geolocation functionality, forcing users to search manually.
No real-time updates for branch availability or transaction limits.
Limited multilingual support (no tourist-friendly interface).

https://azn.day.az [2]
Another local aggregator that lists exchange rates.

Strengths:
Simple and intuitive interface.
Updated regularly, approximately every 10 minutes.
Weaknesses:
Focuses solely on rates without navigation tools or detailed service information.

Bank-Specific Websites
Most banks in Azerbaijan publish exchange rates on their official websites (e.g., Kapital Bank, PASHA Bank).
Weaknesses:
Require users to visit multiple sites for comparisons.
Do not include geolocation, transaction limits, or other convenience features.

9.2. User Questionnaire Insights

To support the market research we also asked typical clients of the currency exchanges in Baku several questions as to what would be suitable. This is particularly important where there is no enough competitive services on the market (we identified only 2 in Baku). We received 16 answers from different group of users. Here are the diagramms:




















From the survey data:
Key Challenges Identified:
Lack of up-to-date information (reported by 43.8% of respondents).
Unclear transaction limits or fees (87.5%).
Difficulty in finding nearby branches (100% of tourists).
Lack of safety tips (87.5%)
Desired Features:

The questionnaire results underscore a significant gap in user-friendly, real-time, and accessible solutions. Tourists particularly highlighted the need for safety tips and reliable service details.
International Comparisons
Finance.i.ua (Ukraine) [3]



Strengths:
Aggregates exchange rates across multiple financial institutions.
Offers transaction fee transparency.
Provides different calculators and historical rates.
Weaknesses:
Lacks geolocation or branch navigation tools.
Does not cater to non-native speakers or tourists.

XE Currency App (Global) [4] 


Strengths:
Provides global exchange rate information in real-time.
Offers online exchange services
Weaknesses:
Is not an aggregator, hence biased.
Is global, hence does not provide local navigation features or specific branch details.

Gap Analysis
The analysis reveals a unique opportunity in Baku:
Current Gaps in Local Platforms:
Lack of geolocation and navigation features to nearby exchange offices.
Absence of multilingual support to cater to tourists and non-native speakers.
Limited transparency regarding transaction limits and fees.
No focus on user accessibility for people with special needs, such as those requiring step-free access, accessible parking, or simplified interfaces.
Absence of safety tips for tourists, such as identifying trustworthy exchange offices, avoiding scams, and ensuring secure currency handling.
Lack of integration for additional convenience services, such as parking space availability, office hours, or auxiliary financial operations like crypto services.
Missing Features in International Platforms:
Specific local data integration tailored to Baku's banking and exchange landscape.
Tourism-focused functionalities like safety tips, reliable branch ratings or reviews, and guides to trustworthy services.

Implications
The Baku Currency Exchange Rate Finder has the potential to:
Differentiate itself by combining features like geolocation, multilingual support, and user-centric design.
Address the needs of people with special needs, tourists, provide them with safety and convenience information.
Fill the gap in both local and international markets for detailed, real-time, and accessible currency exchange information tailored to users' needs.
