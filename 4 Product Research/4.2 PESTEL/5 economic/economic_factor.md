### 1.1. Introduction to Manat

The Azerbaijani Manat emerged following the country's independence from the Soviet Union, replacing the Soviet ruble as the national currency. [1] In its early years, the Manat maintained remarkable stability, pegged at approximately 0.78 to the US dollar for several years. [2] During this period, President Aliyev proudly declared it "one of the most stable currencies in the world." [3]

### 1.2. Economic Theory on Defending Currency Peg

The Manat's peg to the US dollar proved unsustainable due to Azerbaijan's heavy reliance on the oil market. When oil prices collapse, the Manat's fixed exchange rate prevents the Central Bank of Azerbaijan from effectively intervening in the foreign exchange market to stabilize the currency. This dependency on oil means that fluctuations in oil prices directly impact the Manat's value. To maintain the peg, the Central Bank is forced to purchase foreign currency, which rapidly depleted its foreign reserves. If the crisis contiues long enough, the Central Bank will not have enough foreign currency to maintain the peg, and the currency will devalue, which will result in inflation, a crisis in confidance will result, causing holders of azn to panic and sell their azn, causing the currency to drop even more called a flight to quality. [4]

### 1.3. Azeri Light Crude Oil Price Impact on Manat

The situation was conditioned by the uncertainty in the economic and political environment. This had a critical impact on the activities of the oil companies both in the world and in Azerbaijan Republic during this period in the form of cost savings and cost reduction. When the reserves of the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) reached a critical point, the government resorted to a devaluation.](./img/Oil-price-for-Azeri-Light-brand-from-Jan-2015-to-Jan-2016-Source-authors-chart.png)

#### 1.3.1. First Crisis: February 2015

The first occurred in February when the currency lost more than a third of its value against the dollar, causing what banking expert Akram Hasanov described as "serious damage to people and entrepreneurs." [3]

In feburary 2015, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan abandoned the currency peg to the US dollar.  [2]

#### 1.3.2. Second Crisis: December 2015

The second crisis hit in December when the central bank ceased protecting the Manat's value, resulting in a dramatic 32% drop in a single day. This led to widespread panic, with people rushing to exchange their Manats for dollars, shops closing their doors, and banks imposing strict exchange limits while exchange offices ran out of dollars entirely.

#### 1.3.3. Floating Exchange Rate

In the context of currency exchange, a "corridor" refers to a predetermined range within which a central bank aims to keep the exchange rate of a currency, essentially setting a ceiling and floor for how much the currency can fluctuate against other currencies; so, "dropping the exchange rate corridor" means the central bank is no longer actively intervening to keep the currency value within that specific range, allowing it to freely fluctuate based on market forces, which is called a "floating" exchange rate. [5]

### 1.4. Return to De Facto Pegging

By 2017, the government implemented significant reforms, dropping the exchange rate corridor and allowing the Manat to float freely. This included removing the 4% trading range restriction and setting a new official rate at 1.7867, the weakest in its history. The reforms also saw an increase in currency conversion limits from $200 to $5,000 per person. 

The overall decline was stark: from 2014 to 2017, the Manat lost approximately 53% of its value, primarily due to the collapse in oil prices, Azerbaijan's main export. This pattern was not unique to Azerbaijan, as similar trends were observed in other oil-dependent economies like Russia and Kazakhstan.


## 2. Implications

With the Azerbaijani Manat currently operating under a soft peg to the US dollar at a fixed rate of 1.7, there remains an uncertainty surrounding its stability. This system, while currenctly providing stability, in 2023 S&P Anlaysis assumed that the peg will remain until 2026. [7]

> "Nevertheless, in our view, should hydrocarbon prices drop sharply and remain low for a prolonged period, the authorities could consider adjusting the exchange rate. This would help avoid a substantial loss of foreign-currency buffers, similar to the central bank's actions in 2015"

In October 2024, the Azerbaijani Ministry of Finance's forecast predicts that the manat's exchange rate will stay at its current level through 2028. [8] Despite this, there is still an uncertainty surrounding the long-term sustainability of the peg.

In a plausible future scenario where oil prices significantly decline, there would likely be another loss of confidence in the Manat. This could lead to another rush by individuals and businesses to exchange their Manats for US dollars, up to the maximum amount allowed by the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA). Such behavior would reflect a flight to safety as people seek to safeguard their wealth against potential currency devaluation.
