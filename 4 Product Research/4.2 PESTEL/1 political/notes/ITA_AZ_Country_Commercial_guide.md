## 1. What is the ITA?

The ITA is the International Trade Administration, which is a part of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

## 2. Methods of Payment

### 2.1. Overview:
Retail transactions in Azerbaijan are predominantly cash-based, though electronic payment systems are becoming more common.

- **Cash Transactions**: The primary method for retail transactions; widely accepted in urban and rural areas.
- **Electronic Payments**:
  - **Credit/Debit Cards**: Available for use in many retail locations, though foreign cards are not universally accepted.
  - **ATMs**: Accessible in major cities and towns, supporting local and some international card networks.
  - **Mobile Payments**: Emerging but not widely adopted, with limited operational capacity.
- **Large Transactions**: Typically processed through **inter-bank wire transfers**.
- **Checks**: Personal checks are not accepted anywhere in Azerbaijan.
- **Currency**: All payments must be conducted in Azerbaijani manat (AZN).
- **Credit Ratings and Collections**: Azerbaijan has a credit rating agency, but the systems for rating and collections are still underdeveloped.

## 3. Banking Systems

### 3.1. Role and Challenges:
The banking sector in Azerbaijan plays a limited role in financing economic growth due to systemic constraints.

- **Credit Accessibility**:
  - Limited availability of loans for private businesses.
  - High interest rates (10-35% or higher for dollar-denominated loans).
  - Strict collateral requirements deter widespread borrowing.
- **Private Finance**: Many firms rely on private financing sources rather than bank loans.
- **Sectors Receiving Bank Loans**:
  - Construction
  - Telecommunications
  - Food Processing
  - Packaging
- **Correspondent Banking**:
  - Few Azerbaijani banks maintain relationships with Western financial institutions.
  - Western businesses typically rely on a small group of trusted local banks.

### 3.2. Banking System Statistics (as of January 1, 2023):
- **Total Assets**: 47 billion manat (~$27.6 billion).
- **Total Liabilities**: 41.4 billion manat (~$24.3 billion).
- **Total Capital**: 5.6 billion manat (~$3.2 billion).
- **Dollarization Reduction**:
  - Manat deposits increased in 2022.
  - Dollarization fell from 54% in 2021 to 50.8% in 2022.
- **Currency Stability**: The manat exchange rate has remained stable.

## 4. Foreign Exchange Controls

### 4.1. Characteristics:
Azerbaijan operates under a liberal foreign exchange system, allowing for the free movement of funds.

- **Currency Conversion**:
  - Generally unrestricted.
  - Conversion and fund transfer into freely usable currency occur at market-clearing rates.
- **Investment Climate**: Refer to the **Conversion and Transfer Policies** section of the Investment Climate Statement for details on regulatory policies.

## 5. U.S. Banks and Local Correspondent Banks

### 5.1. Presence and Relationships:
- **U.S. Banks**: No U.S. banks have branches in Azerbaijan.
- **Local Correspondents**: Only a few Azerbaijani banks maintain correspondent relationships with U.S. banks.

### 5.2. Key Implications:
- Businesses operating in Azerbaijan should prepare for a cash-heavy economy with limited acceptance of foreign cards.
- Financing through local banks may be expensive due to high interest rates and stringent terms.
- Cross-border businesses might encounter challenges with the limited presence of U.S. financial institutions.
