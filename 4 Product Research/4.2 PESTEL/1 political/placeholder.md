## 1. Political Factors

Because our projects is currently limited as a data collection and visualization tool, and not an online currency exchange platform, we have an inherent lower interaction and impact from the political shperes of influence. However, if the project is expanded to include an online currency exchange platform, politics has a core intreset in protecting its monetary system and thus plays a larger role in planning for the project.

### 1.1. Domestic Azerbaijan Trends

Recent trends show an increased tightening of media and political freedoms, reflecting broader state efforts to manage dissent and maintain power. These policies influence Azerbaijan's financial systems, including currency policies and exchange controls. For example, measures to stabilize the manat after the 2015 devaluations have involved active interventions, highlighting the government's role in directly influencing the currency market to align with political and economic goals.

Such trends suggest that a project incorporating currency data visualization in Azerbaijan may encounter regulatory oversight if perceived to interact with or disrupt monetary policy frameworks. This underscores the need for careful navigation of compliance and permissions in future developments.

#### 1.1.1 Trend of Azerbaijan Crackdown

There have been numerous cases where individuals in Azerbaijan faced legal penalties for online activities, often under pretexts that human rights organizations consider dubious or politically motivated.

1. **Crackdown on Activism and Journalism**: Activists, journalists, and bloggers have been arrested and charged with offenses like hooliganism, drug possession, smuggling, or extortion. These charges are often regarded as fabrications to suppress dissent and free expression.
   
2. **Online Expression as a Target**: Criticisms of government officials, political commentary, or content perceived as violating "social norms" have led to detentions and arrests. Social media has become a focal point for such government actions.

3. **Allegations of Torture and Rights Violations**: Several detainees have alleged torture, and many human rights groups recognize them as political prisoners.

4. **Systematic Silencing of Media Outlets**: Independent media platforms, such as *Toplum TV* and *Abzas Media*, have faced closures, detentions of their staff, and travel bans for reporting on sensitive issues.

5. **Recurring Patterns**: Many individuals arrested faced similar charges across years, indicating a systemic approach to suppress opposition and dissent under the guise of upholding laws.

This ongoing suppression of online freedoms is viewed as inconsistent with international human rights standards, which protect freedom of expression and opposition to political oppression. The cases also underscore the importance of international scrutiny and advocacy for digital rights in restrictive environments.

### 1.2. Geopolitical Tensions and Trade Policies

Ongoing geopolitical events, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and U.S.-China trade conflicts, introduce volatility into currency markets. These tensions influence exchange rate trends and demand for stable currency pairs. Platforms must adapt to abrupt changes, such as sanctions-related currency restrictions or fluctuating demand for safer assets like the U.S. dollar, Swiss franc, or British pound.
