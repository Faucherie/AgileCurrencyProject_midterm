# Reason for the project

This project was conceived to address critical gaps in the current methods of finding currency exchange rates in Baku, Azerbaijan. Existing platforms like [azn.day.az](https://azn.day.az/) and [azn.az](https://azn.az/) are widely used and appreciated for their functionality. These websites allow users to compare exchange rates across multiple banks, update information frequently (e.g., every 10 minutes), and support multiple languages, including Azerbaijani, Russian, and English. These features make them accessible and helpful for both locals and tourists.

However, despite their strengths, these platforms lack certain key functionalities that could significantly enhance the user experience. For instance, they do not provide geolocation features to help users find nearby exchange offices or ATMs. This limitation forces users to rely on manual research, often checking multiple websites and physically visiting offices, which can be inefficient and time-consuming. Additionally, neither platform includes detailed information on transaction limits, office hours, or safety considerations—features that would be especially beneficial for tourists navigating an unfamiliar city.

Our project aims to bridge these gaps by developing a tool that combines the best features of existing platforms with new, user-focused functionalities. By using up-to-date data from [infobank.az](https://infobank.az/) and incorporating geolocation technology, the application will allow users to find the nearest exchange points quickly and efficiently. It will also provide essential details, such as transaction limits, office hours, and safety tips, ensuring that users have all the information they need to make informed decisions.

Tourists, in particular, will benefit from these enhancements. Many avoid using credit cards due to security concerns and rely heavily on cash. Having access to real-time information on nearby exchange offices and their services will alleviate many challenges they currently face. Locals will also benefit from the tool’s ability to streamline the process of finding the best exchange rates, saving time and effort.

In summary, this project addresses an unmet need in the market by combining real-time data aggregation, geolocation, and additional user-centric features. It will not only simplify financial decision-making but also provide a safer, more convenient experience for both locals and tourists in Baku.
