# Reason for the project

Here’s a brief explanation based on how people in Baku find exchange rates, which I think can help guide our project.
In Baku, people typically use websites like [azn.day.az](https://azn.day.az/) and [azn.az](https://azn.az/). These platforms are quite popular and provide useful information about exchange rates offered by different banks.

## 1. What’s useful about these websites.
- They allow users to check and compare exchange rates from multiple banks.
- [azn.day.az](https://azn.day.az/) update their data frequently (e.g., every 10 minutes).
- [azn.day.az](https://azn.day.az/) support multiple languages (Azerbaijani, Russian, and English), making more accessible for tourists.

## 2. What could be improved.
- Neither website uses geolocation to show nearby exchange offices, which would be very helpful for users.
- There’s no detailed information about transaction limits.
- For tourists, it’s hard to know which exchange offices are open, especially if they avoid using credit cards due to security concerns.

## 3. How people currently solve this issue.
- Most people rely on manual research—checking multiple websites and then physically visiting exchange offices. This can waste time, especially if the office is closed or doesn’t offer the rates they need.

## 4. These examples highlight opportunities for us to make improvements.
- Aggregate data from all banks and exchange offices.
- Use geolocation to help users find the nearest open and available exchange points.
- Include extra features like transaction limits, and safety tips, which would be especially useful for tourists.
