## Scope

This project is designed to provide users with a platform to optimize their currency exchange experience in Baku, Azerbaijan. The platform will address two key challenges: finding the most competitive exchange rates and locating the nearest bank branches. By leveraging real-time data and geolocation technology, the application will cater to locals and tourists seeking reliable and convenient currency exchange services, with a focus on multilingual accessibility.

To achieve this, the project will be delivered as a bilingual application, supporting Azerbaijani, Russian, and English. This ensures inclusivity for the local population and accessibility for international tourists. The application will be web-based, allowing seamless use across desktops and mobile browsers without requiring installations. Hosting will utilize a cloud service such as AWS or Google Cloud, ensuring scalability, availability, and security.

Exchange rate data will be collected using API integration with infobank.az, which aggregates rates reported by Azerbaijani banks to the Central Bank. This automated collection ensures real-time updates and consistency while minimizing errors. Additionally, the application will integrate with the Google Maps API to provide users with an interactive map of Baku. Users will be able to locate nearby branches or ATMs, filter results by exchange rate competitiveness, and navigate seamlessly.

The platformâ€™s functionality will be enhanced by combining map-based visuals for branch locations with graphical tools to compare exchange rates across banks. Multilingual support will be integrated throughout the interface, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for both locals and tourists.

Limitations:
This platform is not a financial advisory service and will not facilitate online transactions or manage user funds. Instead, it focuses on delivering accurate, real-time information and bilingual mapping tools to enhance convenience and usability for a diverse audience.
