# SWOT Analysis

## **Strengths**

The platform's **strengths** lie in its user-centric functionality, which combines real-time exchange rate data with geolocation services to simplify financial decisions. This dual-focused approach is highly appealing to both locals and tourists, addressing their specific needs intuitively. As a web-based application, it ensures accessibility across multiple devices without requiring installation, further enhancing convenience for users. Integration with `infobank.az` provides reliable, real-time updates based on data mandated by the Central Bank, ensuring the platform’s trustworthiness. Additionally, the inclusion of Google Maps API for geolocation and navigation sets this project apart by enabling users to locate nearby exchange offices efficiently, which is a standout feature not commonly available in similar tools.

## **Weaknesses**

However, the project also has notable weaknesses. The team faces challenges related to limited experience in software development, particularly in areas such as managing geolocation APIs, web hosting, and database systems. These gaps in expertise could extend development timelines and necessitate additional resources. Furthermore, the platform relies heavily on `infobank.az` for data, which introduces a dependency risk. Service interruptions, restricted access, or delayed updates could hinder the platform’s functionality. While a contingency plan involving web scraping from bank websites is in place, this fallback is less reliable and requires continuous maintenance.


## **Opportunities**

The project offers significant opportunities to leverage. Azerbaijan’s growing tourism sector creates a rising demand for reliable currency exchange solutions. Tourists, as a key user base, would greatly benefit from enhanced transparency and geolocation features. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) engaged in cross-border trade represent another potential audience, as the platform can streamline and optimize their currency exchange processes. Beyond Baku, the platform is scalable to other cities in Azerbaijan and potentially internationally to regions with similar needs. Collaborations with local banks, exchange offices, and tourism agencies also provide opportunities to increase visibility and generate revenue through sponsorships or premium listings. 

## **Threats**

Despite its strengths and opportunities, the platform must address several threats. The competitive landscape includes large financial institutions or tech companies with substantial resources that could develop competing tools with broader features. Economic volatility, including fluctuations in exchange rates or unexpected political or economic crises, may impact the relevance and reliability of the platform’s data, especially for international users. Additionally, the collection and management of user location data present privacy risks. Any mishandling of this data could damage user trust and invite regulatory scrutiny, particularly under stringent global data protection standards.
