# SWOT Analysis

## Strengths

The main strength of our project is that it will encompass analytical support in the simplest
interface possible, which would widen the spectrum of potential users. It is important to mention
that at a later stage, there would also be available an expert version with more complex features
for professional financial analysts. But it, of course, depends on the preferences of the majority
of experts.
In addition to that, the combination of technology our application uses for analysis is not that
frequently used, yet, as outlined in section “Reason for Using Sentiment Analysis”, promising,
which opens up a new perspective in analysis support software development

(note from reviewer: Complex does not have to mean complicated e.g.e pilot systems. Need to focus more carefully on particular aspects that make this application simple and to whom?)

## Weaknesses

Our main weakness is that our project for now lacks software representation, which poses a
risk, that when the program is implemented, it would not work as intended or would
underperform in some unexpected ways. Another potential weakness is that our team lacks
expert software development skills, which will make it harder to implement our idea. Finally,
when it comes to determining sentiment of some particular news, it sometimes may not be
representative of the company’s actual wellbeing [7], because of the financial statement
manipulation problem, which affects the market and investors in a major way every year.
Unfortunately, sometimes it is impossible to gather the truth from the media sources, and as
such, our application, in cases like these, might be inaccurate

(note from reviewer: No accoun for this in the projcet plan e.g. trainging required)

## Opportunities

There are several clear opportunities, when it comes to our project. First of all, the underlying
market of this project is now valued at 6.32B$ and is expected to reach 11.02B$ with compound
annual growth rate of 11.24% [8]. Secondly, almost half of adults, for example, in the US have
some of their money invested in the stock market [9]. Of course, another opportunity that
separates this project from other competitors is that our platform serves as an educational
resource in the form of statistical data, not as a financial advisor that manages some individual’s
savings. As such, our users would not depend financially on our application, which would allow
more space for any technical difficulties or errors, leading to possible decline in the use of robo
advisors, and increase in the use of financial analysis support systems

## Threats

One of the main threats of possible underperformance of our application is an unexpected
event. A clear example would be the 2020 crisis, which unexpectedly resulted from the spread
of a worldwide epidemic, which initiated in Wuhan.
Another potential threat is a large company with massive resources and a brand creating a
competing product with an equal or better performance, improved technology or additional
features, which would make their product more distinctive.
