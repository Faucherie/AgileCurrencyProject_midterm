## Aims and Objectives

**Aim:**  
Our primary aim is to develop a web-based application tha allows both locals and tourists, to easily identify the best currency exchange rates and locate nearby bank branches in Azerbaijan. By providing real-time, accessible, and accurate information, the application seeks to enhance financial decision-making and convenience in the Baku market.

**Objectives:**  
1. Conduct research to validate the necessity and feasibility of the proposed application, using data from `infobank.az` and similar platforms with redundancy plans in case of data unavailability.   
2. Perform market analysis to identify potential competitors and evaluate their strengths and limitations.  
3. Develop an initial prototype that demonstrates key functionalities, such as rate comparison and branch geolocation, with a clear explanation of design decisions.  
4. Conduct usability testing with our local team member to ensure the application meets user needs effectively.  
5. Refine the design and features based on user feedback, ensuring the application meets user needs effectively.  
6. Document the development process with a critical evaluation, addressing challenges, inaccuracies, and areas for future improvement.  
7. Ensure the application adheres to accessibility standards and is scalable for potential expansion beyond Baku in the future.
