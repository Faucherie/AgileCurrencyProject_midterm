To avoid **Forieghn exchange (FX) risk**, "the risk of exposure to financial loss due to the fluctuation of an exchange rate
change when trading with countries that have a different currency." [1] The Trade Finance Guide published by the U.S. Department of Commerce recommends SMEs to opperate in U.S. dollars to avoid FX risk. However,  this is not always possible and there is a trend to require exporters to accept payment in foreign currency. Also This prodect is intended to optimise exchange rates for cash on the ground in Azerbaijan, and it is more likely for enterprices to opperate with bank transfers rather than cash. Therefore SMEs are an unlikely stakeholder.
