## Stakeholders

We have identified two main stakeholder groups: **locals in Baku** and **tourists**. with one other tertiary stakeholder group: **small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)**.

At the core are **locals in Baku**, who frequently require currency exchange services for travel, foreign purchases, or occasional financial needs. While the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on this group is moderate—given their primary use of the Azerbaijani manat—the application simplifies the process of finding favorable exchange rates and nearby bank branches. This convenience makes the tool an essential resource for locals seeking quick and reliable exchange services without extensive effort or research. Aditional as we will see later, in cases of financial emergencies, locals will be the first to use the application in hopes to find the best exchange rates and nearby bank branches as quickly as possible.

Another critical stakeholder group is **tourists**, who rely heavily on currency exchange services during their visits to Azerbaijan. Tourists are significantly impacted by exchange rate fluctuations, as these directly influence their spending power. They need tools that provide accurate comparisons and convenient access to nearby branches, making this application particularly valuable. They are also targetted by merchants offering inflated exchange rates to tourists. By addressing these needs, the application enhances the travel experience and supports the growing tourism sector in Azerbaijan.

Additionally, **small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs)**, particularly those involved in international trade, represent another potential stakeholder group. These businesses often face significant exposure to exchange rate fluctuations [1], which can affect their profit margins. While SMEs are not the primary target audience for the application, they may find value in its ability to provide accurate rate comparisons for foreign transactions. This utility can support SMEs in optimizing their exchange strategies and minimizing financial risks.
