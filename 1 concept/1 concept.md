## Concept

The proposed project is an application designed to help users quickly find the best currency exchange rates and the closest bank branches in Azerbaijan, with an initial focus on the city of Baku. The app targets both locals seeking favorable exchange rates and tourists unfamiliar with the local banking landscape. Unlike online banking platforms, this application does not facilitate financial transactions but serves as a convenient tool to compare rates and locate bank branches.

The appâ€™s core functionality relies on data from Azerbaijani banks, which are required to report their exchange rates to the Central Bank. This information, available on platforms such as infobank.az, will be integrated into the app to provide accurate and real-time updates. Additionally, geolocation features will allow users to filter results by proximity, making it easier to find branches nearby offering competitive rates.

This tool aims to address a common challenge faced by users in navigating varying exchange rates and branch locations, particularly in a busy urban setting like Baku. By streamlining access to this information, the application enhances financial decision-making and convenience. The project has significant potential to benefit both locals and tourists while promoting transparency in currency exchange services.
